    <h1>AKAN NAMES</h1>
</div>
<div class="par">
<p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born. The gender too plays a major 'role' in the naming. 
To forge the spirit of pan-africanism here is a little platform to have fun and get to know if you lived with the Akan what your name would be. Feel free to fill your name, gender and precisely your day,month and year of birth. Have fun won't you? and don't have the fun alone, share with your friends and family<span >&#128513;</span>.</p>
